# CS-340-Project-Two

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by following industry standard format, using object oriented programming, and frequent in line comments. Using CRUD methodology also helps maintain adaptable code because the fundamental use of the application's function is already built. In the future this Python module could be expanded to include more search criteria, format the data in different ways, or even export the data for outside use.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try my best to approach problems from the bottom up as a computer scientist. My approach to this project was to begin with understanding how to use Dash and Plotly before taking on building out the dashboard. Also, by confirming any queries on the database inside of the database before placing them into the Python code. By working from the bottom up, one section at a time, and testing in between, it allowed me to know where I was receiving errors throughout the building process. In the future I would use this same strategy when approaching client requests as well as following the development lifecycle. Mapping out what the database looks like before creating it is very important.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists maintain, create, and analyze computer's and code in order to solve problems or create solutions. My work on this type of project would benefit a company because it would allow them to better format their data for quicker analyzation. This could help with scheduling, performance metrics, or even training. Having a better format of data not only helps performance, but accelerates productivity.
